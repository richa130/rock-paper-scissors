This project was an introduction to basic JavaScript concepts/syntax, as well as using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.

Link to the project:

The first part of the project did not include any GUI, just the basic underlying JS logic. I used functions, if statements, switch statements, for loops, etc. to make the logic following the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

The goal of the second part was to add buttons using HTML and CSS, and to implement those buttons' functionality with JavaScript. I used eventListeners for the buttons, and changed the textContent of certain elements to reflect score changes/results.
